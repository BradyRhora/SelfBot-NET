I used to be an adventurer just like you, but then I took an arrow in the knee. 
I used to be an adventurer just like you, but then I took a sword in the chest. 
The guards have been talking about you. 
By the gods, I dont know what to say. 
Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll. 
So you know alchemy? Maybe you could make me some mead. 
My cousin is out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty.
I can handle the occasional drunk or bandit. I don't know about dragons.
Hail summoner, why don't you go and conjure me up a warm bed? 
So you can cast a few spells, am I supposed to be impressed? 
Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me. 
Watch the skies, traveller. 
Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers. 
No lollygaggin'. 
You couldn't possibly be the Dragonborn of legend, could you? 
They say Ulfric Stormcloak murdered the High King... With his voice! Shouted him apart! 
Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer. 
Heard about you and your honeyed words. 
Go fiddling with any locks around here, and we're going to have a real problem. 
Hands to yourself, sneak thief. 
I'd be alot happier and a lot warmer with a bellyful of mead. 
Go cast your fancy magic somewhere else. 
If I find your hand in my pocket, I'm going to cut it off. 
By Shor, is that... is that Azura's Star? How did you come to possess such a rare treasure? 
You wield... Azura's Star? How... how can such a thing be possible? 
That's a fine shield you have there. Dwarven isn't it? 
I find your wolfish grin... unsettling 
Is that...fur? Coming out of your ears? 
Lightly armoured means light in your feet. Smart. 
A guard could get nervous, someone approaching with their weapon drawn. 
You are like me then. You don't fancy those big clunky two-handed weapons 
The gods gave you two hands, and you use them both for your weapon. I can respect that. 
You can trade in that junk at... 
Iron armour heh... now that's true nordish armour 
Psst...I know who you are. Hail Sithis. 
You know, I could have gone into that Sanctuary, wiped out all those Dark Brotherhood types... But I was... Sick, that day.
That mace... get it away from me! 
Get that acursed mace away from me! 
Stop right there criminal Scum! You broke the Law, Now pay the court a fine, or face jail time 
You have commited crimes against Skyrim and her people, what say you in your defence? 
Then Pay with your blood!
